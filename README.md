# LazAR
Welcome to a small AR game where you guide the lazer through a level (making sure to hit the checkpoint along the way, and mind the black hole bending the lazer!) to win the game.

This was a school project made for my first semester of my Software Development bachelor. The game was made in Unity, using their XR Interaction Toolkit, for Android phones. It taught me just how much further AR has yet to go (It's so shaky).

# How To
Since the game uses picture recognition to determine where you are placing and moving your mirros, you will have to add the pictures manualy inside Unity, and then make a build for you to play it.
Just follow the instructions to do this:
1. Prepare valid images, for example books or other rectangular flat objects
2. Download the Unity project here
3. Open it as a Unity project
4. Find the 'ReferenceImageLibrary' object under 'Assets -> ImageTrackingImages'
5. Add valid images to the library
6. Build
7. Ready to play!
